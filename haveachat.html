            <h1>Did you know that Age UK offers two different types of befriending services to combat loneliness in later life?</h1>
            <h3><strong>Call in Time telephone befriending service</strong></h3>
            <p>Call in Time is a national service where a volunteer befriender will phone an older person at an agreed time for a chat.
              <br>The older person is matched with a befriender who has similar interests, who will provide friendly conversation and companionship on a regular basis over a long period of time.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Face-to-face befriending</h3>
  Befriending services are available at many local Age UKs. They will often involve a volunteer befriender visiting an older person in their home, perhaps for a cup of tea and a chat, or accompanying them to an activity (such as a trip to a cafe or the theatre). In some cases, a volunteer may accompany the older person to occasional hospital or doctor's appointments.</p>
